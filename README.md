# DevSession

DevSession helps you continue your coding session seamlessly across multiple devices.

It automatically restores the files you were working on and places your cursor exactly where you left off — so you can switch machines without losing focus.

## ✨ Features
- Restore previously opened files
- Restore cursor position (line & column)
- Seamless workflow across multiple devices
- Works offline with no external services
- Simple JSON-based session file
- Git & cloud-sync friendly

## 🔧 How It Works
DevSession stores your session state in a single file inside your workspace:

.devsession.json

This file can be synced using Git, Dropbox, OneDrive, or any file-sync service.
When you reopen the project, DevSession automatically restores your session.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
DevSession is privacy-first by design:
- No internet access
- No cloud accounts
- No data collection
- No tracking

All session data stays local and fully transparent.

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Continue work between home and office
- Resume coding after reboot
- Seamless multi-device development
- Focus-driven workflows

## 📦 Installation
